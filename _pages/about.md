I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science at [Tianjin University, China](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/) since the fall of 2025 supervised by Prof Wei Feng. During my graduate student period, my research interest includes computer vision, gaussian splatting and multimodel.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Software Engineering from Zhengzhou University, China.

# News
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
